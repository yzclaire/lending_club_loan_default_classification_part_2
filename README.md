# lending_club_loan_default_classification_part_2
The 2nd part of Lending Club Loan Default Classification Project - Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

The project is split into 3 parts. This notebook is the [Part 2 - Lending Club Loan Data - Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering](https://yzclaire.github.io/lending_club_loan_default_classification_part_2/)

### Outlines of the whole project

#### 1. Define goal 

    a.Identify most important attributes separating bad loans and good loans 
    b.Build Xgboost model to make prediction
    
#### 2. EDA

    a.Data first impression
      -available predicting variables
      -data distribution
      -missing values
    b.Split dataset in to training and test set
    c.correlation analysis and remove multicollinearity
    d.Data Visualization to explore relationship between target and predicting variables
    
#### 3. Data cleansing and Feature Engineering

    a. Impute missing values
    b. Transform any characteristics or categorical variables into numeric
    c. Create new features from existing features

#### 4. Feature Selections
    a. Remove variables according to correlation analysis
    b. Logistic regression with L1 regularization (coeffecients not zero)
    c. Random Forest model built-in feature importance
    
####  Data Preprocessing

#### 5. Build Model and evaluate model performance with validation set 
    a. Logistic regression with L1 regularization model
    b. Random Forest model 
    c. Xgboost model
        -hyperparameters Tuning
        
 
#### 6. Assess any additional feature engineering or feature selection opportunity based on model results

#### 7. Choose the best model and run prediction on test dataset

#### 8. Evaluate final model performance 

#### 9. Areas of improvements
